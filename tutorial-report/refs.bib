	abstract = {Image segmentation plays a crucial role in many medical-imaging applications, by automating or facilitating the delineation of anatomical structures and other regions of interest. We present a critical appraisal of the current status of semiautomated and automated methods for the segmentation of anatomical medical images. Terminology and important issues in image segmentation are first presented. Current segmentation approaches are then reviewed with an emphasis on the advantages and disadvantages of these methods for medical imaging applications. We conclude with a discussion on the future of image segmentation methods in biomedical research.},

	abstract = {Image segmentation and object recognition are among the most fundamental problems in computer vision, and the potential interaction between these tasks has been discussed for many years. The usefulness of recognition for segmentation has been demonstrated with various top-down segmentation algorithms, however, the impact of bottom-up image segmentation as pre-processing for object recognition is not well understood. One factor impeding the utility of segmentation for recognition is the unsatisfactory quality of image segmentation algorithms. In this work we take advantage of a recently proposed method for computing multiple stable segmentations and illustrate the application of bottom-up image segmentation as a preprocessing step for object recognition and categorization. We extend a popular bag-of-features recognition model to provide multiple class categorization and localization of objects in images. We compare our categorization results to that of a conventional bag-of-features recognition model on the Caltech and PASCAL image databases.},

As image pixels are generally unlabelled, the commonly used approach for the same is clustering. This paper reviews various existing clustering based image segmentation methods. Two main clustering methods have been surveyed, namely hierarchical and partitional based clustering methods. As partitional clustering is computationally better, further study is done in the perspective of methods belonging to this class. Further, literature bifurcates the partitional based clustering methods into three categories, namely K-means based methods, histogram-based methods, and meta-heuristic based methods. The survey of various performance parameters for the quantitative evaluation of segmentation results is also included. Further, the publicly available benchmark datasets for image-segmentation are briefed.},

	abstract = {Introduction:
The segmentation method has a number of approaches, one of which is clustering. The clustering method is widely used for segmenting retinal blood vessels, especially the k-mean algorithm and fuzzy c-means (FCM). Unfortunately, so far there have been no studies comparing the two methods for blood vessel segmentation. Many studies do not explain the reason for choosing the method.

Aim:
This study aims to analyze the performance of the algorithms of k-means and FCM for retinal blood vessel segmentation.

Methods:
This research method is divided into three stages, namely preprocessing, segmentation, and performance analysis. Preprocessing uses the green channel method, Contrast-limited adaptive histogram equalization (CLAHE) and median filter. Segmentation is divided into three processes, namely clustering, thresholding and determining the region of interest (ROI). In the thresholding process, the determination of the threshold value uses two methods, namely the mean and the median. The third stage performs performance analysis using the performance parameters of the area under the curve (AUC) and statistical tests.

Results:
The statistical test results comparing FCM with k-means based on AUC values resulted in p-values {\textless}0.05 with a confidence level of 95\%.

Conclusion:
Retinal vascular segmentation with the FCM method is significantly better than k-means.},

The clusters can then be used as discrete attributes for representing the entire image (this is known as a bag-of-visual-terms representation).},
