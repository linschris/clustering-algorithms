# Fuzzy C Means And K Means Algorithm
## An implementation of the Fuzzy C Means and K Means clustering algorithms, used for developing centers for collections of data points. The examples use blobs of data points and images.

### Installation

1. Clone the repo
```sh
git clone https://github.com/linschris/clustering-algorithms.git
```
2. Install the dependencies
```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt (Python2)
pip3 install -r requirements.txt (Python3)
```
### Getting Started

Navigate to the code folder and run examples.py in a Code Editor.
[//]: # (TODO: figure out how any user may get started. Elaborate on this)


### Gratitude

A special thanks to these tutorials, explanations, and guides for teaching me the
knowledge to understand, implement, and manipulate these algorithms:
